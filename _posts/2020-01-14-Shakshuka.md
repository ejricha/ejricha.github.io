Here's my first blog post!

## Ingredients
* **Vegetable Oil** (2 Tbsp)
* **Onions** (2 or 3 medium)
* **Frozen tomatoes** (half a pound)
* **Canned tomatoes** (14 oz whole)
* **Eggplant** (1 medium)
* **Garlic** (3 cloves)
* **Cumin** (1/2 Tbsp)
* **Smoked Paprika** (1/2 Tbsp)
* **Half a Lemon** (juice)
* **Parsley** (1/2 cup chopped)
* **French Bread** (1 loaf)
* **Eggs** (7)

## Recipe

1. Start by heating a few tablespoons of oil in a pan, over medium heat. I'm using my saute pan because it's new and I wanted to try it out, but it ended up working out great. Nothing really sticks to the pan with this recipe, so you don't really need a nonstick pan; an enameled dutch oven would probably also work well. I *don't* recommend cast iron, because there are a lot of acidic foods in here that will (slightly) harm the pan's seasoning.
1. Dice the onions, and add to the heated oil. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until slightly translucent.

1. For tomatoes, I used a 14 oz can of whole tomatoes, as well as about half a pound of frozen ones. I still have many tomatoes in my freezer from when my garden was producing too many of them, both plum and tomato. Add them to the onions, and cook for another 5 minutes. Stirring isn't as vital now, until all the liquid from the tomatoes starts to thicken.

1. I cooked my eggplant ahead of time. In fact, that was the whole reason I chose this recipe, I googled "what can i make with leftover eggplant" and picked the first thing that came up [1][1]. If you haven't cooked your eggplant yet, add it to pan now.

1. Add the eggplant now if it was already cooked ahead of time.

1. Chop the cloves of garlic.

1. Preheat the oven to 400 or whatever, for the bread.

1. Keep an eye on the sauce, stirring occasionally. Once you can scrape a spatula on the bottom and it takes the sauce a few seconds to recover, it is thick enough.

1. Wash your eggs. Especially if they come from chickens like ours, that can't seem to lay in the nesting box regularly.

1. Scrape some sauce to the side to form holes for the eggs. Yes, the sauce will re-fill the holes, but that's not bad. You should also add a half a teaspoon or so of oil to each hole, and give it a minute or so to heat up.

1. Once the oil is hot, add eggs to all the holes. I used 7 eggs, but in hindsight this may veggies could have supported an engineer's dozen (12). Cover.

1. Chop the parsley. You should have about half a cup when it is done.

1. After about 5 minutes, check the eggs. Once the whites look like they are set, they are probably done. Our eggs are small, and I definitely overcooked mine.

1. Add the juice of half a lemon, top with the parsley, and serve with the french bread.
